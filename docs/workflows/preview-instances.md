# Preview Instances

Preview Instances are used to share your work with your colleagues and with some stakeholders. Preview Instances are different than **Stages** as it includes both code and data when spun up from your personal instance.

```
# Share your project from Cloud Shell
> cloud

# Edit your code locally and watch the changes automatically
# deploy into your own personal instance

# Share your work on personal instance with your colleagues
> share
```

```
# Share your project directly from your terminal
> cloud share
```

Note that preview instances are deleted when they're no longer used. So, it's discouraged to use preview instances for sharing the applications with the world. You can use stages for permanent hosting of your applications.

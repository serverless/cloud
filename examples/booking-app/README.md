**Serverless Booking App**

To get started, clone this repo, and navigate into the `src` directory...

```
git clone https://github.com/serverless/status.git
cd src
```

Install the Cloud CLI (in package.json)
```
npm i 
```
or install it globally with 
```
npm i -g @serverless/cloud
```

Next, start your Serverless Cloud experience with the `start` command...

```
npm start or cloud start
```

Finally, you'll need to set the `TOKEN_SECRET` param in the [Serverless Cloud Dashboard](https://cloud.serverless.com) to any strong value of your choice. This will be what user's passwords are hashed with.
